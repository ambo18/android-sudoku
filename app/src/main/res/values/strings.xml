        Sudoku is a game that contains 81 squares: \n
        - 9 rows and 9 columns. \n\nIn traditional Sudoku, each block must contain a digit
        between 1 and 9, but because this is the programmer\'s
        edition, each block must contain a digit between 0 and 8.
        Each digit can only be repeated once in each row and each
        column.\n\nThe Sudoku puzzle is also composed of 9 square (3x3)
        blocks that also must contain the digits 0 to 8 and they
        must appear only once as well.
